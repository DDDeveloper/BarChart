##Compatibility Requirements
Before using Bar Chart, make sure your project meets its requirements.  
 - Bar Chart works on iOS 4.2 and higher, however the sample project only runs on iOS 5.0 and higher.  
 - Bar Chart now uses Objective-C ARC. If your project does not use ARC, add the ARC flag to the **Bar Chart** files in your project's Compile Sources section: `-fobjc-arc`  
 - You must add the `CoreGraphics` framework to your project
